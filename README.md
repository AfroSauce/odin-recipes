This is my very first website, created entirely using HTML as part of The Odin Project’s Foundations course. The project is a simple recipe website that features a homepage and multiple recipe pages, each linked together and styled using standard HTML elements.

Throughout this project, I’ve practiced using a variety of HTML tags including paragraph tags, italic tags, list tags, and the basic HTML boilerplate. I’ve also added images to the pages and created internal links to navigate between them.
