    <p>Spaghetti Aglio e Olio is a traditional Italian pasta dish that’s 
        as simple as it is flavorful. Made with just garlic, olive oil, 
        and red pepper flakes, this recipe lets basic ingredients shine. 
        The name translates to "spaghetti with garlic and oil," 
        which perfectly sums it up.</p>

    <p>Ideal for a quick dinner, it’s light, aromatic, and comes together 
        in under 20 minutes. Garnished with fresh parsley, it’s a go-to 
        for busy days or when you want a restaurant-worthy meal with 
        minimal effort.</p>
